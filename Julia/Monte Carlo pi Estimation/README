### Monte Carlo π Approximation ###
This project was developed as part of the "Advanced Simulation Modeling" class. It demonstrates the application of Monte Carlo methods to approximate the value of π.

Overview
Monte Carlo methods are a class of algorithms that rely on random sampling to obtain numerical results. The basic idea is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. The steps generally include:

In this specific case, the Monte Carlo method is applied to approximate the value of π. The approach follows the example provided on Wikipedia for Monte Carlo modeling:

How to Run
Ensure you have Julia installed, and you can run the Jupyter notebook either through Jupyter Notebook or any other platform that supports Julia notebooks.
